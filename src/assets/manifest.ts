/**
 * Asset manifest — the single place that lists what gets loaded and when.
 * Files live in public/ (URLs are relative to the page, so 'images/x.png'
 * means public/images/x.png; works in dev and in the deployed subdirectory).
 *
 * Two tiers (the pattern production RUN games use):
 *   - 'critical'  — awaited during the loading screen. Everything the first
 *                   interactive screen needs: menu art, UI chrome, the sprites
 *                   visible in the first seconds of play.
 *   - 'deferred'  — fire-and-forget background load after boot. Sub-screen
 *                   art, late-game content, anything the player can't see yet.
 *
 * REAL ART GOES HERE. The template draws placeholder art procedurally
 * (src/game/textures.ts), so both tiers ship empty — but every art slot has
 * an alias, and listing an image under that alias REPLACES the placeholder,
 * one sprite at a time, no code changes:
 *
 *   { alias: 'player', src: 'images/player.png' }
 *
 * Recognized aliases (art spec with sizes in CLAUDE.md): player, jelly,
 * balloon, spike, slime, coin, pad, cloud, city, hills, ground, sky.
 * Keep 'critical' small: every asset there delays first interaction.
